# WIFI-Radar-mapping
 üì° A 2D radar-style mapping of surrounding WiFi signals using a custom-built 2.4GHz Modular Parabolic Dish Antenna. 
 This project is a practical test to evaluate and demonstrate the functionality and directional 
 performance of the antenna created in a previous repository: https://github.com/SudoTraceRoute/2.4GHz-Modular-Parabolic-Dish-Antenna

## üì° Project Overview

The goal of this project is to map WiFi signals surrounding an apartment using a highly directional 2.4GHz parabolic dish antenna. This "radar-style" scan visually presents the strength and distribution of WiFi networks when scanned with:

- A **custom-built parabolic dish antenna** (directional)
- A **standard omnidirectional antenna**

By comparing the resulting maps, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of the parabolic antenna in terms of range, directionality, and signal isolation.

## ‚ú® Features

- 2D radar-style map of WiFi networks in the environment
- Comparison between custom **parabolic** and **omnidirectional** antennas
- Visual legend of signal strengths
- Uses free, open-source tools (e.g., `aircrack-ng`) for scanning
- Screenshots of mapping process and results included
