- I have used free version of ChatGPT to generate the radar like images based on the signal strength and
  position of the antenna's angle wich I have uploaded to him as a .csv file. 
- Needless to say, he has ignored my instructions, and every time he would finally "100% undrestood what to do" his resources would get blocked, 
and response would be "at the moment I cant perform advanced data analysis". 
- Although it was only about a graphical adjustment of the signals dots on the map, not to perform any data filtering etc..
